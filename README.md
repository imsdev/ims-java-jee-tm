# Creating a Java EE application that accesses an IMS transaction

The following tutorials demonstrate how to use the the J2C Java™ Bean wizard to build a simple web application for IMS™ transactions.

* Create a J2C application for an IMS inbound transaction (coming soon)
* Create a J2C application for an IMS transactions containing arrays (coming soon)
* Create a J2C application for an IMS transaction containing variable length and multiple segments (coming soon)
* [Create a J2C application for an IMS phone book transaction](https://github.com/imsdev/ims-java-jee-tm/tree/master/phonebook)

## Prerequisites
In order to complete these tutorials, you should be familiar with:

* J2EE and Java programming.
* Basic IMS Transaction Manager (IMS TM) concepts.

## Featured Technologies

* [IBM® WebSphere® Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP/mapfiles/product_welcome_was.html): An application server used to run Java™ virtual machine (JVM) user applications.
* [Rational Application Developer®](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRTLW/rad_family_page.html): A complete environment for Java, Java EE, web, web services, SOA, OSGi, Web 2.0, mobile, and portal designers and developers, including server development tools.
* Information about your IMS environment: In these tutorials, your application interacts with an IMS application program in IMS. You need to obtain information such as the host name and port number of IMS Connect and the name of the IMS data store where the transaction runs. Contact your IMS systems administrator for this information. Several tutorials may require you to perform additional setup work in IMS.
