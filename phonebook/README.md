# Create a J2C application for an IMS phone book transaction

The following example demonstrates how to use the J2C wizard to build a simple web application that processes an IMS™ transaction that returns a phone book record.

This tutorial is divided into several exercises that must be completed in sequence for the tutorial to work properly. This tutorial teaches you how to use the J2C Java™ Bean wizard to create a Java bean that runs a transaction in IMS. While completing the exercises, you will:

* Use the J2C Java bean wizard to submit a transaction to IMS. 
* Create a Java method, runPhonebook.java, which accepts a customer number and returns information about the customer.

To use this sample, you must have an application server installed and configured. To verify that a server runtime environment is available, click **Window > Preferences**, expand Server, and then click **Installed Runtimes**. You can use this pane to add, remove, or edit installed server runtime definitions. You can also download and install support for a new server.

## System Requirements 

To complete this tutorial, you need to have the following tools and components installed: 

* IBM® WebSphere® Application Server, version V7.0, V8.0, V8.5, or V9.0.
* J2EE Connector (J2C) tools installed
*	Information about your IMS environment: In this tutorial, your application interacts with an IMS application program in IMS. You need to obtain information such as the host name and port number of IMS Connect and the name of the IMS data store where the transaction runs. Contact your IMS systems administrator for this information. Specifically, you need to perform some setup work in IMS if you want to run the IMS\PhoneBook IMS program. 
*	A copy of the COBOL file ex01.cbl: You may locate this file in your product installation directory: <installdir>\IBM\SDP70Shared\plugins\com.ibm.j2c.cheatsheet.content_7.0.0\samples\IMS\PhoneBook. If you want to store it locally, you can copy the code from here: [EX01.cbl](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRTLW_9.6.1/com.ibm.j2c.doc/resources/ex01.html).
*	A clean workspace.

## Select a resource adapter

1.	If the Java™ EE icon, ![EEicon](./media/j2ee_perspective.gif) , does not appear in the top right tab of the workspace, you need to switch to the Java EE perspective. From the menu bar, select **Window > Open Perspective > Other**. The Select Perspective page opens.
2.	Select **Java EE**, and click **OK**. The Java EE perspective opens.
3.	In the Java EE perspective, select **File > New > Other**. 
4.	In the New page, select **J2C > J2C Bean**. Click **Next**.
5.	In the Resource Adapters Selection page, select **IMS TM**. For this tutorial select **IMS TM Resource Adapter (IBM:10.2.0)**. Click **Next**. 
6.	On The Connector Import page, select **WebSphere® Application Server v. 9.0.** 

![J2C_Wizard](./media/imsconnectorpagev9.jpg)

7.	On the Adapter Style page, select **Outbound**.

![J2C_Wizard](./media/imsadapterselection.gif)

8.	On the Scenario Selection page, select **IMS COBOL, PL/I, or C-based applications**. 

![J2C_Wizard](./media/jndiname.gif)

9.	In the Connection Properties page, select **Managed connection**. 
10.	If you already have a JNDI connection created, click **Browse** to locate your JNDI. If you do not have a JNDI connection, click **New**.
11.	On the Server Selection page, select **WebSphere Application Server v9**.
12.	Click **Next**.
13.	On the New J2C Connection Factory page, accept the default Connection class name of com.ibm.connector2.ims.ico.IMSManagedConnectionFactory. In the blank fields, enter all the required connection information. Required fields, indicated by an asterisk (*), include the following: 
    1. **For TCP/IP connection**: 
        1. **Host name**: (Required) The IP address or host name of IMS Connect.
        1. **Port Number**: (Required) The number of the port used by the target IMS connect. 
    1. **For local option connection**:
        1. **IMS Connect name**:(Required) The name of the target IMS connect. 
    1. **For both**:
        1. **Data Store Name**: (Required) The name of the target IMS data store. 
#### Important
You can obtain the connection information from your IMS system administrator.

14.	When you have provided the required connection information, click **Next**.

## Setting up the Web project and Java interface and implementations

1.	All work done in the workbench must be associated with a project. Projects provide an organized view of the work files and directories, optimized with functions based on the type of project. In the workbench, all files must reside in a project, so before you create the J2C bean, you need to create a project to put it in. In the New J2C Bean page, type the value `IMSPhoneBook` in the Project Name field. 
2.	Click the **New** button beside the Project Name field to create the new project
3.	In the New Source Project Creation page, select **Web project**, and click **Next**.
4.	In the New Dynamic Web Project page, ensure that the following values are selected, and click **Finish**: 
    1. **Project name**: IMSPhoneBook
    1. **Contents**: accept default
    1. **Target Runtime**: WebSphere® Application Server v9.0
    1. Dynamic Web Module Version: 2.5
    1. Configuration: accept default
    1. **Add project to an EAR**: checked
    1. **EAR Project name**: IMSPhoneBookEAR
5.	A dialog box appears asking if you would like to switch to the Dynamic Web perspective. Click Yes.
6.	On the J2C Java Bean Output Properties page: 
    1. In the Package name field, **click Browse** and select the IMSPhoneBook project. Click OK.
    1. Type sample.ims in the Package name field.
    1. Type PhoneBook in the Interface name field.
    1. Type PhoneBookImpl in the Implementation name field.
    1. Clear Save session as ant script.
7.	Click **Finish**.

## Creating the Java method

1.	In the Snippets view, select **J2C**. Double click **Add method** to J2C Java bean. 
2.	In the Java Methods page, click **Add**.
3.	In the Name field, type `runPhoneBook`.
4.	In this step, you import the Ex01.cbl (COBOL) file that is needed to create your application. The Ex01.cbl file is located in <installdir>\IBM/IBMIMShared/plugins/com.ibm.j2c.cheatsheet.content\Samples/MS/phonebook, where <installdir> is the directory where this product is installed. The COBOL file contains the application program that runs on the IMS™ server. It has the definition of the structure to be passed to the IMS server via the communications area. This structure represents the customer records being returned from the IMS application program. Before you can work with a file, you must import it from the file system into the workbench. Beside the Input type field, click **New**. 
5.	In the Data Import page, ensure that the Choose mapping field is COBOL_TO_JAVA. Click **Browse** beside the COBOL file.
6.	Locate the Ex01.cbl file in the file system, and click **Open**.

####	Now you creates a Faces JSP to deploy the J2C Java bean:
24.	Expand the IMSPhoneBook project, and find the WebContent folder. 
25.	Right click WebContent folder in your IMSPhoneBook project and select **New > Other > Web > Faces JSP file**. 
26.	Type Test in the Name field.
27.	Accept defaults for all other fields. 
28.	Click **Finish**.
29.	Next you add the Java bean to faces JSP: Once you have created the Faces JSP file, the page should open Test.jsp in the Design page. If the workspace does not open in the Design page of the editor, expand the WEB-INF folder under the WebContent folder. Right click Test.jsp, select **Open With**, and click **Page Designer**. Test.jsp opens in the Design page.
30.	The Palette view appears on the right panel. If it does not appear, in the top menu, click **Window > Show view > Palette**.
